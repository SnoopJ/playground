A little script for selecting a random Zoom virtual background

If you want to use this for yourself:

    1) Add some custom virtual background to Zoom (doesn't matter what it is)
    2) Edit `TARGET_FILE` below to match the location of the copy of this image
       that Zoom made
    3) Edit `CANDIDATE_BG_PATHS` below to match the location(s) of the images
       you want to select from
    4) Run this program any time you want to rotate your background. I plan to
       put mine into a system service

The idea here is that Zoom always looks at this file for 'that' background, so
if we swap the original file for some other image, our background is different.

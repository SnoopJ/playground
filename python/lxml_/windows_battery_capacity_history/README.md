![Plot showing design and actual battery capacity from Jan 2022 to Feb 2024. The design capacity hovers around 45,000 mWh, although it does dip for a bit in the middle of 2023. The actual capacity wobbles around a bit, with a high-water mark of ~38,000 mWh, falling to closer to ~31,000 mWh in 2023, and plummeting to ~10,000 mWh at the end of the available data.](out.png)

This sample attempts to demonstrate the difference between "regular" packages
(ones defined by the presence of an `__init__.py`) from ["namespace" packages](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)

In brief summary:

* Namespace packages only let you do/define useful things in subpackages  
* Regular packages have `__init__.py` which is a natural place to do/define "top-level" stuff
